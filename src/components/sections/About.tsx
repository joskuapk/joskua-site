        Hi, I’m Joskua — a freelance developer based in Mexico City. I believe
        that technology should make life easier, smarter, and more human. Over
        the past 5+ years, I’ve worked with teams across the US, Mexico, Central
        America and Asia, building real-world systems that power loyalty
        programs, optimize business processes, and bring ideas to life.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base md:text-lg mb-4 text-light-blue">
        I’ve led development teams, launched cross-platform apps, and integrated
        solutions with POS systems and payment platforms — always with a focus
        on clean code, usability, and impact.
